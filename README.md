SimpleSeq
=========

SimpleSeq is a collection of tools to process and analyze sequencing and other data files.  

These scripts are intended to be:

(*) Simple
(*) Correct
(*) Dependency-free as much as reasonably possible and portable
(*) Well-documented and commented
(*) Adaptable and extensible
(*) Descriptively named
(*) Fast, insofar as speed doesn't comprimise the above goals

This collection is a work in progress and input and contributions from the community are most welcome.
