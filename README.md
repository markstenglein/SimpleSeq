SimpleSeq
=========

<p>
SimpleSeq is a collection of tools to process and analyze sequencing and other data files.  

These scripts are intended to be:

<ul>
<li> Simple
<li> Correct
<li> Dependency-free as much as reasonably possible and portable
<li> Well-documented and commented
<li> Adaptable and extensible
<li> Descriptively named
<li> Fast, insofar as speed doesn't comprimise the above goals
</ul>

<p>
This collection is a work in progress and input and contributions from the community are most welcome.
